## OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to explore and analyze the Delivery Center's order and delivery data, using data analysis techniques to generate relevant insights that can support decision-making and optimize operational processes. The focus will be on identifying patterns, trends, and opportunities for improvement in the sales and delivery ecosystem.

## CONTEXT

The Delivery Center is a platform that connects retailers and marketplaces, creating a robust ecosystem for selling goods and food in the Brazilian retail market. With multiple operational hubs across Brazil, the platform facilitates the daily processing of thousands of orders and deliveries, involving a vast network of retailers and delivery partners.

Given the significant volume of daily transactions, leveraging data for decision-making becomes a crucial competitive advantage. This project aims to transform the available data into valuable insights, contributing to improvements in operational flow and business strategy.
